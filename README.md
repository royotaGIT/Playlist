For this project, you and up to two partners (if you like!) will work on creating a series of files designed to mimic a playlist of songs much like a Spotify or iTunes playlist. As part of practicing with GitHub, your submission will be a link to your GitHub repository. To recieve full credit your project must have at least 5 commits with included messages. All partners must submit at least one commit.

The Playlist object should contain a collection of Song objects - each Song should have a title, artist, duration and status of whether the song is "liked" associated with it

The playlist should demonstrate the following functionality
  a) adding a song 
  b) liking a song
  c) removing a song
  d) examining all songs
  e) examining a sublist of just liked songs
  f) determining the total duration of said playlist
  g) removing all unliked songs in the playlist through a single method - be careful when removing elements from a list
